# Sublime Text Configuration Settings

Environment settings for Sublime Text 2/3.

## Packages

The following packages should be installed:

- Package Control (https://packagecontrol.io/)
- Base16 Color Schemes
- GitGutter
- LESS
- MarkdownEditing
- SFTP
- SideBarEnhancements
- Syntax Highlighting for SASS
- Theme - Soda
- TrailingSpaces
- TypeScript

## Usage

Settings can be used by replacing the `Packages/` directory for your Sublime
Text installation with a link to the `Packages/` directory in this repo. Make
sure to copy over any files from the existing installation that do not exist in
this repo.

You can override synced settings by placing preference files in the
`Packages/User/` directory generated by Sublime Text.

The gitignore file is setup to automatically filter out files generated by
Sublime Text that the user does not edit directly (3rd party packages, caches,
local caches, etc.). This allows Sublime Text to freely use this repo as its
`Packages/` directory, without polluting the repo itself.

Once the `Packages/` directory is placed or linked correctly use git commands to
push and pull configuration changes to sync across all devices.
